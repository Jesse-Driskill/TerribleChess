
Background

TerribleChess -- Chess but all the pawns are replaced by checkers pieces, kings have teleportational portal abilities, queens are transformed into explosive cannons, and you can randomly place tic tac toe marks on the board to win a game of tic tac toe (and thereby winning the game of chess), or you can use your move to force your opponent to solve a riddle(if they lose the wordle/riddle, losing them a piece if they get it wrong. Designed to be as unplayable as possible.


In TerribleChess players will be able to place pieces, drag and drop pieces, take their opponents pieces, and win games.
In addition, TerribleChess will have an explanatory guide and custom sound effects for the moving and capturing of the pieces and have a mini gamemode called connect 2.

For now, I only see TerribleChess needing Canvas for the rendering, webpack for bundling the code, npm to manage dependencies, and howler for sound management.
